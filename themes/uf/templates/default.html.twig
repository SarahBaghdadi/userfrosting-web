            A framework and an application.
        </h3>
        <p class="flow-text">
            UserFrosting is a web framework for PHP.  Like other web frameworks, it offers a complete toolbox of programmatic components for building your application.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Unlike other PHP frameworks, <em> it's a fully-functioning user management application,</em> right out of the box.  And, it's fully extendable so that you can easily create the custom features you need.

        Step up your game.
        </h3>
        <p class="flow-text">
            UserFrosting is designed to bring new and returning developers up to speed with the modern PHP community.  You'll be comfortably introduced to Composer (the dependency manager), object-oriented design patterns, and the PHP Standards Recommendations (PSR), making your code better structured and easier to manage.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            What's more, you'll learn how to use Node.js and Bower to cleanly manage client-side packages (Javascript and CSS).  Transform yourself from a code monkey into a software engineer.
