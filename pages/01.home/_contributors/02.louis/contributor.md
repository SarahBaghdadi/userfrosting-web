Louis is a civil engineer from Montréal, Québec who has a passion for coding. Over the last 15+ years, he has worked on many small projects, learning everything on his own before getting involved with bigger projects. Louis created UserFrosting's Internationalization module, a module crucial to him as a multi-lingual software developer in Canada, where software requires support for both official languages, English and French, as well as UserFrosting's Bakery CLI interface. Overall, he likes to share his knowledge by helping others, the same way he was helped when he first started coding.
