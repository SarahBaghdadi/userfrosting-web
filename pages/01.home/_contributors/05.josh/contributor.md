Josh is a wrongly titled digital marketing assistant who is responsible for everything from IT through to social media management. His passion for web development was sparked back in 2011 when trying to access a hidden function on a website due to it's terrible UI. Josh manages the UserFrosting Facebook presence providing updates to the community and extending the reach of UserFrosting. He is often stalking chat at 'weird' hours due to his east coast Australian timezone where he is often the first person to respond. Currently a Computer Science student at the University of Wollongong, he gets way less sleep than he should.
