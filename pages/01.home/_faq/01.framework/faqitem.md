title: What's the difference between a login script and a framework?
---

At least 90% of the time spent on a software project is spent not on writing new code, but reading and debugging existing code.  Therefore, it is important to put a lot of care into producing a well-designed **application**.  Starting with a framework like UserFrosting is a good way to ensure that you (or others) will be able to understand and maintain your code months or years after the initial work is completed.  Anything you find online that bills itself as a "login script" is probably _not_ going to help you produce a piece of software that is built to last.  While a framework involves a bit of a learning curve compared to "plain PHP," you'll come out a better, more mature developer with a finished project that won't need to be constantly rewritten.
